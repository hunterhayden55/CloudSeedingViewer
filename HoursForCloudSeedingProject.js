// HOURS FOR THE CLOUD SEEDING PROJECT
// All hours will be recorded here until I am added to the payroll again
// (DO NOT ADD HOURS TO THE NSF PROEJECT TIMESHEET!!!!)
//
// 10/8: 11:30am - 11:45am Gained access to the data and briefly examined it and what/how many files are included.
//
// 10/10: 10:00am - 10:15am Went over files to see data structure and what each section/data value meant.
//
// 10/13: 8:30pm - 10:45pm Downloaded all data files and created main directory for where all code for it will be stored. Downloaded WCT tool and began examining it to see the different functions and how it works. 
//
// 10/15: 9:15pm - 12:45am Looked over LROSE and a couple other options to see what would be some alternatives to WCT. Determined that WCT is the best option right now. Made the plan for how I want to display 2D and 3D data (hopefully will be able to do both). Parsed the cloud seeding flight data files and now they are geojson files. Started getting the historical radar data ready. 
//
// 10/22: 11:00pm - 12:45am Started downloading frame by frame radar data for the flights. Started creating webpage that will show the flight paths and radar data.
//
// 10/23: 9:00am - 1:15pm Continued working on webpage and got it to show the plane's position and path and move along the path. Got it so radar data now shows up accurately and updates properly as the plane moves along the path. 
// TOTAL: 12.25 hours (UPDATE THIS AFTER EACH SHIFT!!!)
